> **Pro tip:** Read one non-technical book per month during your PhD. It takes 4--6 hours, and the return on investment in terms of writing skill, productivity, and mental health is enormous. Schedule it like you schedule lab meetings.

> **Budget tip:** Check if your university library has ebook access before buying. Many of these books are available through institutional subscriptions (O'Reilly, SpringerLink, university library databases). Also check for legally free PDFs on author websites --- several books on this list are freely available from the authors.
