## Recommended Starter Kit

If you are just starting your PhD, install these tools first:

1. **Zotero** (reference management) + browser extension
2. **Overleaf** (LaTeX writing and collaboration)
3. **VS Code** (coding) + Python + LaTeX Workshop extensions
4. **Google Scholar** + **Semantic Scholar** (literature search)
5. **Git + GitHub** (version control for code AND papers)
6. **Weights & Biases** (experiment tracking)
7. **draw.io** (diagrams)
8. **Grammarly** or **LanguageTool** (writing quality)

This covers 90% of what you need. Add specialized tools as your workflow demands them.

> **Pro tip:** Do not spend weeks evaluating tools. Pick one from each category, use it for a month, and switch only if it genuinely does not work for you. The best tool is the one you actually use consistently, not the one with the most features.
