# Should I Submit to This Journal? Decision Tree

> **Use this decision tree before submitting to any venue.** Walk through each question honestly. Skipping a question because you do not like the answer is how papers end up desk-rejected after a 3-month wait.

## The Decision Tree

```
START HERE
    |
    v
Q1: Is the journal/conference indexed in SCI, Scopus,
    or a recognized database?
    |
    +-- NO --> Is there a specific, legitimate reason to
    |          submit to a non-indexed venue?
    |          (e.g., new but reputable venue, invited paper,
    |           specific community you want to reach)
    |              |
    |              +-- NO --> DO NOT SUBMIT. Find a better venue.
    |              |
    |              +-- YES --> Proceed with caution. Verify it
    |                         is not predatory (see checklist below).
    |                         Continue to Q2.
    |
    +-- YES --> Continue to Q2
                   |
                   v
Q2: Does your paper fit the journal's scope?
    (Read the Aims & Scope page. Check recent publications.)
    |
    +-- NO --> DO NOT SUBMIT. Scope mismatch = desk rejection.
    |          Find a journal whose scope matches your work.
    |
    +-- MAYBE --> Read 5 recent papers from the journal.
    |             Does your paper belong alongside them?
    |                 |
    |                 +-- NO --> Find a different venue.
    |                 +-- YES --> Continue to Q3.
    |
    +-- YES --> Continue to Q3
                   |
                   v
Q3: Is your paper's quality at the level of papers
    recently published in this journal?
    (Be honest. Compare your methodology depth,
     experimental rigor, and writing quality.)
    |
    +-- NO, it is below --> Can you improve it to that level
    |                       within a reasonable timeframe?
    |                           |
    |                           +-- NO --> Submit to a lower-tier
    |                           |          journal where your paper
    |                           |          IS competitive.
    |                           |
    |                           +-- YES --> Improve first,
    |                                      then submit.
    |
    +-- YES, it matches --> Continue to Q4
    |
    +-- YES, it exceeds --> Consider submitting to a
                            higher-tier journal. Do not
                            undersell your work!
                            Continue to Q4.
                   |
                   v
Q4: Can you afford the timeline?
    |
    +-- Journal review: 2-6 months typical
    |   Conference review: 1-3 months typical
    |
    |   Do you need this published by a specific deadline?
    |   (graduation, job application, tenure review)
    |       |
    |       +-- YES, and the timeline is too slow
    |       |   --> Consider a faster venue, or submit
    |       |       to a conference instead.
    |       |
    |       +-- NO, timeline is acceptable
    |           --> Continue to Q5
    |
    v
Q5: Are there any financial constraints?
    |
    +-- Does the journal charge an APC (Article Processing Charge)?
    |       |
    |       +-- YES --> Can you or your institution pay it?
    |       |              |
    |       |              +-- NO --> Find a journal without APCs
    |       |              |          or with APC waivers.
    |       |              |
    |       |              +-- YES --> Continue to Q6
    |       |
    |       +-- NO (no APC) --> Continue to Q6
    |
    v
Q6: Do all co-authors agree on this venue?
    |
    +-- NO --> Discuss and reach consensus before submitting.
    |          Submitting without co-author agreement causes
    |          serious problems.
    |
    +-- YES --> Continue to Q7
                   |
                   v
Q7: Have you verified the journal is NOT predatory?
    |
    +-- Check against:
    |   [ ] Clarivate Master Journal List
    |   [ ] Scopus Source List
    |   [ ] DOAJ (for open access journals)
    |   [ ] Think.Check.Submit checklist
    |   [ ] No unsolicited emails from this journal
    |   [ ] Editorial board members are real, verifiable scholars
    |   [ ] Publisher is reputable (IEEE, Springer, Elsevier,
    |       Wiley, ACM, MDPI*, Taylor & Francis, etc.)
    |
    |   * MDPI: legitimate but controversial. Some institutions
    |     do not count MDPI publications. Check your local policy.
    |
    +-- PASSES all checks --> Continue to Q8
    |
    +-- FAILS any check --> DO NOT SUBMIT.
                            Predatory publications can
                            damage your career.
                   |
                   v
Q8: Is the paper actually ready to submit?
    |
    +-- Have you completed the pre-submission checklist?
    |       |
    |       +-- NO --> Complete it first.
    |       |
    |       +-- YES --> Continue
    |
    +-- Has your advisor read and approved the manuscript?
    |       |
    |       +-- NO --> Get advisor approval first.
    |       |
    |       +-- YES --> Continue
    |
    +-- Is this the best version of the paper you can
        produce right now?
            |
            +-- NO --> Keep working on it.
            |
            +-- YES
                 |
                 v
    +================================+
    |                                |

## Quick Reference: Red Flags for Journals

If ANY of these are true, think twice:

| Red Flag | Risk Level | What to Do |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| You received an unsolicited email inviting submission | HIGH | Almost certainly predatory. Ignore. |
| Journal promises review in < 2 weeks | HIGH | Legitimate peer review takes time. |
| Journal name is suspiciously similar to a famous journal | HIGH | Check the exact publisher and ISSN. |
| No identifiable editorial board | HIGH | No accountability. Avoid. |
| Journal publishes papers in wildly different fields | MEDIUM | Could indicate low standards. |
| Journal website has poor grammar/design | MEDIUM | Reputable publishers invest in their websites. |
| APC is suspiciously low (< $200) or not disclosed | MEDIUM | Legitimate OA journals have transparent pricing. |
| Journal's claimed IF cannot be verified on Clarivate | HIGH | They may be fabricating metrics. |
| Journal is indexed in ESCI but not SCIE | LOW | ESCI is legitimate but lower prestige. Acceptable for many purposes. |
| Journal is Scopus-indexed but not in Web of Science | LOW | Scopus has broader coverage. Usually fine. |

## Quick Reference: Green Flags for Journals

If MOST of these are true, the journal is likely a good choice:

| Green Flag | Why It Matters |
|------------|---------------|
| Published by IEEE, ACM, Springer, Elsevier, Wiley, or Cambridge UP | Established, reputable publishers |
| Indexed in SCI/SCIE with a verifiable Impact Factor | Quality control confirmed |
| You recognize names on the editorial board | Active, reputable researchers |
| Your advisor recommends it | Advisor knows the field's norms |
| You regularly read papers from this journal | It is relevant to your community |
| The journal has been publishing for 10+ years | Stability and track record |
| Colleagues in your field publish there | Community acceptance |

## Special Scenarios

### "I need a publication fast for graduation"

Understandable, but do not submit to a predatory journal. Instead:
1. Submit to a reputable journal with fast review times (check Publons data)
2. Submit to a workshop or symposium (faster acceptance cycles)
3. Upload to arXiv as a preprint (instant, and increasingly valued)
4. Consider a letters/short communication format (faster review than full papers)

### "My advisor wants me to submit here, but I disagree"

Have an honest conversation. Present your reasoning using the criteria in this decision tree. If the advisor insists and the journal is legitimate, follow their guidance --- they have more experience with venue politics.

### "The journal rejected my last paper"

That is fine. You can submit a new, different paper to the same journal. If you are resubmitting a revised version of the same paper, check whether the journal allows resubmission (some do, some do not).

### "Two journals seem equally good"

Flip a coin. Seriously. If two journals are equally appropriate, the difference in outcome will be minimal. Spending three weeks agonizing over the choice is worse than picking one and submitting.

> **Final thought:** The best journal for your paper is the one where the readers are most likely to benefit from and build upon your work. Prestige matters for career advancement, but impact matters for science. When possible, optimize for both.
