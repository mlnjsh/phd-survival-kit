# Pre-Submission Checklist

> **Use this checklist before submitting any manuscript.** Go through every item systematically. A single overlooked issue can lead to desk rejection or unnecessary revision rounds. Print this out and check items off with a pen if that helps you focus.

---

## Content Quality

- [ ] **Title** is concise, specific, and accurately reflects the paper's contribution (avoid vague titles like "A Novel Approach to...")
- [ ] **Abstract** is self-contained (150--250 words), states problem, approach, key results with numbers, and significance
- [ ] **Abstract** contains no citations, undefined acronyms, or equations
- [ ] **Keywords** (4--6) are specific enough to help discoverability but not so narrow they miss relevant searches
- [ ] **Introduction** clearly states the problem, gap in existing work, and your specific contributions
- [ ] **Contributions** are explicitly listed (numbered or bulleted) in the Introduction
- [ ] **Related work** is thorough, fair, and up-to-date (check for papers published in the last 6 months)
- [ ] **Methodology** is described with enough detail for someone to reproduce your work
- [ ] **All claims** are supported by evidence (experimental results, citations, or formal proofs)
- [ ] **Results** are presented with appropriate statistical measures (confidence intervals, p-values, standard deviations across runs)
- [ ] **Ablation study** is included to justify each component of your method
- [ ] **Limitations** of your work are honestly discussed
- [ ] **Conclusion** summarizes contributions and outlines concrete future work
- [ ] **Paper tells a coherent story** from problem to solution to validation

## Writing Quality

- [ ] **Grammar and spelling** have been checked (use Grammarly, LanguageTool, or similar)
- [ ] **Sentences are concise** --- remove filler words ("very", "really", "it is important to note that")
- [ ] **Active voice** is used where possible ("We propose X" not "X is proposed")
- [ ] **Consistent terminology** throughout (do not alternate between synonyms for the same concept)
- [ ] **Acronyms** are defined at first use, then used consistently
- [ ] **Tense is consistent** (present tense for established facts, past tense for your experiments)
- [ ] **Transitions** between sections and paragraphs are smooth
- [ ] A colleague or native English speaker has **proofread** the manuscript

## Formatting

- [ ] **Page limit** is respected (check both main paper and appendix limits)
- [ ] **Correct template/style file** is used (download the latest version from the venue website)
- [ ] **Margins, fonts, and spacing** match the submission requirements exactly
- [ ] **Section numbering** is correct and consistent
- [ ] **No orphan lines** (single lines at top/bottom of pages or columns)
- [ ] **Double-blind requirements** are met if applicable (no author names, no self-identifying citations like "In our previous work [1]...")
- [ ] **Page numbers** are included (or removed, per venue requirements)

## Figures and Tables

- [ ] **Every figure and table** is referenced in the text ("As shown in Fig. 3..." not just placed without mention)
- [ ] **Figure captions** are self-explanatory (a reader should understand the figure from the caption alone)
- [ ] **Figures are high resolution** (vector formats like PDF/SVG preferred; at least 300 DPI for raster)
- [ ] **Text in figures is readable** at the printed size (not too small after scaling)
- [ ] **Consistent color scheme** across all figures
- [ ] **Color-blind friendly** palette (avoid red-green only distinctions; use patterns or shapes as backup)
- [ ] **Tables use professional formatting** (booktabs style: \toprule, \midrule, \bottomrule --- no vertical lines)
- [ ] **Best results** in tables are clearly marked (bold, underline, or color)
- [ ] **Table column headers** are clear and include units where applicable
- [ ] **All figures and tables fit within page margins** (no overflow)

## Mathematics

- [ ] **All symbols** are defined before or immediately after first use
- [ ] **Notation is consistent** throughout the paper
- [ ] **Equations are numbered** only if referenced in the text
- [ ] **Equations are punctuated** correctly (they are part of sentences)
- [ ] **Vectors/matrices** follow a consistent convention (bold lowercase for vectors, bold uppercase for matrices)

## References

- [ ] **All references are complete** (author, title, venue, year, pages)
- [ ] **No broken references** (search for "??" in compiled PDF)
- [ ] **References are formatted** per the venue's bibliography style
- [ ] **Self-citations** are reasonable in number (not excessive)
- [ ] **Recent references** are included (at least several from the last 2 years)
- [ ] **Foundational/seminal works** are cited, not just recent papers
- [ ] **arXiv-only papers** are acceptable for the venue (some journals require published references)

- [ ] **No duplicate entries** in the bibliography

## Ethics and Compliance

- [ ] **IRB/Ethics approval** is mentioned if human subjects are involved

- [ ] **Broader impact statement** is included if required by the venue
- [ ] **Conflict of interest** declarations are prepared
- [ ] **Acknowledgments** credit all funding sources and contributors

## Supplementary Material

## Final Checks
