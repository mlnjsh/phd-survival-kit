# Conference Presentation Preparation Checklist

> **Your talk is your paper's marketing campaign.** Most people will hear your talk but never read your paper. A great talk can generate collaborations, citations, and job opportunities. A poor talk wastes everyone's time, including yours. Prepare thoroughly.

---

## 4+ Weeks Before

- [ ] **Confirm your presentation slot** (date, time, session, room, format: oral/poster/spotlight)
- [ ] **Know your time limit** (typically 15--20 min for oral, 5 min for spotlight, 3--5 min for poster pitch)
- [ ] **Identify your audience** (specialists in your sub-field? Broad ML audience? Mixed?)
- [ ] **Draft your slide outline** on paper before opening PowerPoint/Beamer
- [ ] **Decide on your one key takeaway** (if the audience remembers only ONE thing, what should it be?)

## Slide Design

- [ ] **Title slide** includes: paper title, all authors (highlight presenter), affiliations, venue, date
- [ ] **Slide count** follows the 1-slide-per-minute rule (15 min talk = 12--15 content slides max)
- [ ] **Outline slide** gives the audience a roadmap (optional for short talks)
- [ ] **Motivation slides** (1--2) explain WHY anyone should care before diving into HOW
- [ ] **Method slides** (3--5) focus on key ideas, not every detail (the paper has the details)
- [ ] **Results slides** (2--3) highlight the most important findings with clear tables/plots
- [ ] **Conclusion slide** restates the key takeaway, lists future work, shows paper/code links
- [ ] **Thank you / Q&A slide** includes your contact information and links
- [ ] **Backup slides** (3--5) prepared for anticipated questions (ablations, comparisons, proofs)
- [ ] **No slide has a wall of text** (max 6 bullet points, max 8 words per point)
- [ ] **Figures are large and readable** from the back of the room
- [ ] **Animations/transitions** are used sparingly and purposefully (not decoratively)
- [ ] **Consistent color scheme** across all slides
- [ ] **Font size** is at least 24pt for body text, 32pt+ for titles
- [ ] **Every slide has a clear purpose** (if you cannot say what a slide contributes, remove it)

## Content Preparation

- [ ] **Opening hook** prepared (a surprising statistic, a visual demo, a relatable problem scenario)
- [ ] **Jargon is minimized** (define any specialized terms you must use)
- [ ] **Live demo** is avoided unless you have a guaranteed backup (recorded video instead)
- [ ] **Comparison with baselines** is visually clear (highlight YOUR method in tables/plots)
- [ ] **Limitations** are mentioned briefly (shows intellectual honesty, preempts tough questions)
- [ ] **Story arc** flows naturally: Problem -> Why it is hard -> Your idea -> It works -> What is next

## Rehearsal

- [ ] **Practice the talk out loud** at least 5 times (silent read-throughs do not count)
- [ ] **Time yourself** during practice (be strict --- going over time is disrespectful to other speakers)
- [ ] **Practice with a timer visible** so you learn to pace yourself
- [ ] **Record yourself** (video or audio) and watch/listen back for filler words ("um", "uh", "so", "like")
- [ ] **Present to your lab/colleagues** and collect feedback
- [ ] **Present to someone outside your field** to check if the talk is accessible
- [ ] **Practice handling questions** (have someone ask you hard questions)
- [ ] **Prepare 2--3 sentence answers** for the most likely questions
- [ ] **Practice the first 2 minutes** extra --- this is when nerves are highest and first impressions form

## Technical Setup

- [ ] **Slides are in PDF format** as a backup (Beamer/PowerPoint can render differently on venue machines)
- [ ] **Slides are on a USB drive** AND in your email/cloud (two backups minimum)
- [ ] **Laptop adapter/dongle** is packed (HDMI, USB-C to HDMI, VGA if the venue is older)
- [ ] **Fonts are embedded** in the presentation file
- [ ] **Videos/animations** play correctly on a different machine (test this!)
- [ ] **Pointer/clicker** is charged and tested (or plan to use keyboard arrows)
- [ ] **Slide aspect ratio** matches the venue's projector (usually 16:9 for modern venues)

## Day Before the Talk

- [ ] **Visit the presentation room** if possible (check projector, screen size, lighting)
- [ ] **Test your slides** on the venue's equipment during a break
- [ ] **Check the session schedule** --- know who speaks before and after you
- [ ] **Get a good night's sleep** (more valuable than one more practice run at 2 AM)
- [ ] **Prepare water** to bring to the podium

## During the Talk

- [ ] **Arrive at the session 10 minutes early** and load your slides
- [ ] **Face the audience**, not the screen (glance at your laptop for reference)
- [ ] **Speak slowly and clearly** (nervousness makes you speed up --- consciously slow down)
- [ ] **Make eye contact** with different parts of the room
- [ ] **Pause after key points** (silence is powerful and lets the audience absorb information)
- [ ] **Watch the time** and be prepared to skip slides if running late
- [ ] **End on time or slightly early** (the audience will love you for it)

## Handling Q&A

- [ ] **Repeat each question** before answering (ensures everyone heard it, and buys you thinking time)
- [ ] **It is okay to say "I don't know"** followed by "but here is what I think..." or "that is a great direction to explore"
- [ ] **Keep answers concise** (30--60 seconds per answer)
- [ ] **If a question is hostile**, stay calm, acknowledge the point, and respond factually
- [ ] **Direct lengthy discussions offline** ("Great question --- let's discuss this after the session")
- [ ] **Thank the questioner** regardless of the question quality

## After the Talk

- [ ] **Upload slides** to your website, SlideShare, or the conference platform
- [ ] **Follow up** with people who asked interesting questions (exchange cards/emails)
- [ ] **Note down feedback** and questions you struggled with (improve for next time)
- [ ] **Tweet/post about your talk** with a link to the paper and slides
- [ ] **Celebrate** --- public speaking is hard and you did it

> **Pro tip:** The goal of a conference talk is NOT to present every detail of your paper. The goal is to make the audience want to read your paper. Sell the idea, not the implementation.

> **Common mistake:** Spending 80% of the talk on methodology and rushing through results. Your audience cares about what you found, not just how you found it. Aim for a 30/40/30 split: motivation, method, results.
