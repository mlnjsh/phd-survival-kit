# Thesis Defense Preparation Checklist

> **The defense is the final boss fight of your PhD.** But here is the secret: if your advisor lets you defend, you are almost certainly going to pass. The defense is more about demonstrating mastery and composure than about surviving an ambush. Prepare well, and it becomes a celebration of your work rather than an ordeal.

---

## 3+ Months Before

- [ ] **Confirm your defense date** with your committee and department
- [ ] **Reserve the defense room** (check AV equipment, seating capacity, and whether remote attendance is supported)
- [ ] **Distribute your thesis** to committee members with enough lead time (check department requirements --- typically 4--6 weeks before defense)
- [ ] **Confirm committee composition** meets department requirements (internal/external members, minimum count)
- [ ] **File all required paperwork** with the graduate school (defense announcement forms, committee approval forms)
- [ ] **Understand the defense format** at your institution (presentation length, question rounds, public vs. closed portions)

## Thesis Document

- [ ] **Thesis is complete** --- all chapters written, not just drafted
- [ ] **Abstract** summarizes the entire thesis coherently (typically 300--500 words)
- [ ] **Each chapter** has a clear introduction and conclusion connecting it to the thesis narrative
- [ ] **The thesis tells a unified story**, not just a collection of stapled-together papers
- [ ] **Related work** is comprehensive and demonstrates deep knowledge of the field
- [ ] **Future work** chapter shows you understand where the field is heading
- [ ] **All figures, tables, and equations** are properly numbered and referenced
- [ ] **Bibliography is complete** and consistently formatted
- [ ] **Formatting complies** with your university's thesis template (margins, fonts, title page format, etc.)
- [ ] **Table of contents, list of figures, list of tables** are generated and correct
- [ ] **Proofread by at least two people** who are not you

## Presentation Preparation

- [ ] **Presentation length** is confirmed (typically 30--45 minutes for the talk, followed by 30--60 minutes of questions)
- [ ] **Slide count** is appropriate (roughly 1 slide per 1--1.5 minutes of talk)
- [ ] **Title slide** includes thesis title, your name, advisor, committee members, date, and university logo
- [ ] **Outline slide** maps the talk structure clearly

### Slide Content Structure

- [ ] **Motivation** (3--5 slides): Why does this research matter? What real-world problem does it address?
- [ ] **Background** (3--5 slides): Key concepts the audience needs to follow your work
- [ ] **Research questions/hypotheses** (1--2 slides): Clearly stated, specific, answerable
- [ ] **Contribution overview** (1 slide): List your major contributions upfront
- [ ] **For each contribution/chapter** (5--8 slides each):
  - [ ] Problem statement for this specific contribution
  - [ ] Proposed approach / methodology
  - [ ] Key results with quantitative evidence
  - [ ] Brief discussion of what it means
- [ ] **Unified discussion** (2--3 slides): How contributions fit together, overall narrative
- [ ] **Limitations** (1 slide): Honest assessment --- committee respects self-awareness
- [ ] **Future work** (1--2 slides): Concrete next steps, not vague hand-waving
- [ ] **Conclusion** (1 slide): Restate your thesis statement and key findings
- [ ] **Backup slides** (10--15): Detailed results, proofs, additional experiments, methodology details

## Rehearsal

- [ ] **Full rehearsal** with your advisor (get feedback, iterate)
- [ ] **Full rehearsal** with your lab group or peers (simulate Q&A)
- [ ] **Mock defense** with friendly faculty if possible (they will ask different questions than peers)
- [ ] **Timed rehearsal** at least 3 times (you MUST stay within the time limit)
- [ ] **Practice in the actual defense room** if possible (familiarize yourself with the space)
- [ ] **Prepare for the "big picture" question**: "What is the single most important contribution of your thesis?"
- [ ] **Prepare for the "so what" question**: "Why should anyone care about this work?"
- [ ] **Prepare for the "weakness" question**: "What is the biggest limitation of your approach?"
- [ ] **Prepare to explain** any published paper from your thesis in detail (committee may have re-read them)

## Anticipated Question Areas

Prepare thoughtful answers for questions in these categories:

- [ ] **Methodology choices**: "Why did you choose method X over method Y?"
- [ ] **Statistical validity**: "How do you know your results are statistically significant?"
- [ ] **Generalizability**: "Would your approach work on [different domain/data]?"
- [ ] **Scalability**: "How does your method scale to larger datasets/problems?"
- [ ] **Comparison fairness**: "Is the comparison with baselines fair?"
- [ ] **Novelty**: "What is truly new here compared to [related work]?"
- [ ] **Assumptions**: "What assumptions does your method make? When do they break?"
- [ ] **Reproducibility**: "Can someone else reproduce your results?"
- [ ] **Broader impact**: "What are the ethical implications of this work?"
- [ ] **Future directions**: "If you had 3 more years, what would you do next?"
- [ ] **Field expertise**: General questions about your research area (not just your specific work)

## Logistics

- [ ] **Dress code** is appropriate (business casual or formal --- ask your advisor about local norms)
- [ ] **AV equipment tested** (projector, laptop connection, microphone if room is large)
- [ ] **Backup of slides** on USB drive, email, and cloud
- [ ] **Printed copy of your thesis** at the podium (for quick reference during questions)
- [ ] **Water bottle** at the podium
- [ ] **Whiteboard markers** available if you need to sketch during Q&A
- [ ] **Remote attendees** (if any) can connect and are tested before the defense
- [ ] **Someone is handling the recording** if the defense is being recorded

## Day of the Defense

- [ ] **Arrive 30+ minutes early** to set up and test everything
- [ ] **Slides load correctly** on the venue's projector/screen
- [ ] **Take a few deep breaths** --- you know your work better than anyone in that room
- [ ] **Start with confidence** --- your opening sets the tone
- [ ] **Pace yourself** --- speak slowly, pause between sections
- [ ] **During questions**: listen fully before answering, take a moment to think, answer concisely
- [ ] **If you do not know an answer**: say so honestly, offer your best reasoning, suggest it as future work
- [ ] **Stay calm under pressure** --- committee members sometimes push hard to see how you handle it, not because they doubt you
- [ ] **Thank your committee** at the end --- they invested significant time in your work

## After the Defense

- [ ] **Incorporate committee feedback** into the final thesis version
- [ ] **Submit the final thesis** to the graduate school by the deadline
- [ ] **Confirm all paperwork** is filed (signature pages, embargo forms if applicable)
- [ ] **Upload to your institutional repository** (ProQuest, university digital repository)
- [ ] **Celebrate properly** --- this is a major life achievement, do not just go home and sleep
- [ ] **Thank your advisor, committee, lab mates, family, and friends** (in writing, not just verbally)
- [ ] **Update your CV, LinkedIn, and personal website** with Dr. status
- [ ] **Consider publishing** remaining thesis chapters as journal papers

> **Pro tip:** The defense is not an adversarial proceeding. Your committee wants you to succeed. They would not let you defend if they thought you were not ready. Go in with confidence.

> **Mindset:** You are the world's leading expert on the specific topic of your thesis. The committee knows more about the broad field, but nobody knows YOUR work better than you. Own that expertise.

> **Worst case scenario preparation:** If a committee member strongly disagrees with something, do not argue. Say: "That is an excellent point. I would like to think about that more carefully and address it in the final version." This shows maturity, not weakness.
