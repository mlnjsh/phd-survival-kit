# Camera-Ready Preparation Checklist

> **Your paper has been accepted --- congratulations!** Now you need to prepare the final (camera-ready) version. This is the version that will be published permanently, so take it seriously. Sloppy camera-ready preparation is surprisingly common and reflects poorly on authors.

---

## Before You Start

- [ ] Read the **camera-ready instructions** from the venue carefully (every venue is slightly different)
- [ ] Note the **camera-ready deadline** and work backwards to plan your time
- [ ] Download the **latest version** of the venue's style files/template (they sometimes update between submission and camera-ready)
- [ ] Re-read **all reviewer comments** and the **meta-review** one more time to ensure nothing was missed

## Addressing Reviews

- [ ] **All required changes** from the acceptance conditions have been incorporated
- [ ] **Optional suggestions** from reviewers have been addressed where reasonable
- [ ] Changes are **consistent throughout** the paper (if you fix terminology in one place, fix it everywhere)
- [ ] No new content was added that **changes the scope** of the accepted paper (reviewers accepted a specific version)

## Author and Affiliation Information

- [ ] **Remove anonymization** (restore author names, affiliations, acknowledgments)
- [ ] **All author names** are spelled correctly and match the submission portal
- [ ] **Author order** is confirmed and agreed upon by all co-authors
- [ ] **Affiliations** are current (someone may have changed institutions since submission)
- [ ] **Email addresses** are correct and professional
- [ ] **ORCID identifiers** are included if required
- [ ] **Corresponding author** is clearly marked

## Copyright and Legal

- [ ] **Copyright form** is signed and submitted (IEEE, ACM, etc. each have their own)
- [ ] **Copyright notice** is added to the paper footer if required by the venue
- [ ] **License type** is selected if applicable (Creative Commons, etc.)
- [ ] **Open access fees** are paid if you opted for open access
- [ ] **Funding acknowledgments** include all required grant numbers and agency statements

## Formatting

- [ ] Paper uses the **correct camera-ready template** (not the review template)
- [ ] **Page limit** for camera-ready is respected (sometimes differs from submission limit)
- [ ] **Paper ID or DOI** is included where the template requires it
- [ ] **All margins** comply with requirements (some venues use CMS to check automatically)
- [ ] **Font embedding** is confirmed (all fonts embedded in the PDF --- check with `pdffonts` command)
- [ ] **No Type 3 fonts** in the PDF (this is a common rejection reason for IEEE)
- [ ] **Paper compiles cleanly** with no LaTeX warnings about overfull/underfull boxes

## Content Polish

- [ ] **Proofread one final time** (typos in the published version are forever)
- [ ] **Figure quality** is the best possible (replace draft figures with final versions)
- [ ] **All TODO/FIXME comments** in the LaTeX source have been resolved and removed
- [ ] **No placeholder text** remains ("Lorem ipsum", "[TODO]", "XX%", etc.)
- [ ] **Acknowledgments section** thanks reviewers, funding agencies, and collaborators
- [ ] **References are complete** and properly formatted (no "[n.d.]" or missing page numbers)

## Supplementary Material

- [ ] **Code repository** is de-anonymized and publicly accessible
- [ ] **Code is cleaned up** (remove debug code, add documentation, include README)
- [ ] **Data links** are permanent (use Zenodo, figshare, or institutional repositories --- not personal Dropbox)
- [ ] **Supplementary PDF** is updated to match camera-ready changes

## Submission

- [ ] **PDF passes venue's format checker** if one is provided (e.g., IEEE PDF eXpress)
- [ ] **All required files** are uploaded (paper PDF, supplementary, source files if required)
- [ ] **Metadata on submission portal** matches the paper exactly (title, abstract, keywords)
- [ ] **Registration for the venue** is completed (most conferences require at least one author to register)
- [ ] **Presentation format** is confirmed (oral, poster, spotlight) and you know the schedule

## Post-Submission

- [ ] **Upload to arXiv** with the final version (update if a preprint already exists)
- [ ] **Update your personal website** and Google Scholar profile
- [ ] **Share on social media / academic networks** (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, ResearchGate)
- [ ] **Notify co-authors and collaborators** that the camera-ready has been submitted
- [ ] **Save the final version** with a clear filename: `PaperTitle_CameraReady_VENUE2026.pdf`
- [ ] **Prepare your presentation** (if conference paper --- do not wait until the last week)

> **Pro tip:** Run your camera-ready PDF through the venue's format checker early, not on the last day. Format issues (especially font embedding problems on Windows) can take time to debug.

> **Common mistake:** Forgetting to remove anonymous submission artifacts. Search your source for "anonymous", "blind", "removed for review", and similar phrases.
